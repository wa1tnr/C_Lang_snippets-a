notes:

**tertiary fyle** 9 sep pb switch and LED

**TADA** has a counter that does not clear to zero - runs 'forever'.

You can in principle return a single **TADA**, but here, **TADA**
prints (and is _counted_) as often as 'it likes' --
which is somewhat correlated to how long the pb switch
was held down.

You can also make a 'heartbeat' to show that the system
still runs and does other things, while it waits for
a pushbutton press from the human operator of the
wokwi simulation user interface.

end.
