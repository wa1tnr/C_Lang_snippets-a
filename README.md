 * Makefile stunts and other tricks

Looking pretty good.  Good enough to merge into main,
after holding back quite a bit.

Tested nice in wokwi vscode .. simulating an esp32's
tty output (the primary output of this program is
just printf() type utterances).

### update: Wed  5 Jun 16:48:41 UTC 2024

 * now compiles 'cleanly'
 * now runs on wokwi vscode extension
 * does the ask dash thing from last night (Tue 4 Jun)

what more could you ask, back quiet
